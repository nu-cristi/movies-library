# Movies Library - TMDB API

This is a simple movies library app where you can see details about movies in real time and also search and add your favorite movies to your own list. This app was developed using ReactJS for the client side and the TMDB API to manage the data.

## Install and run the project

1. Clone the project:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:nu-cristi/movies-library.git
$ cd movies-library/
```

2. Install dependencies and run the server:

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```

Now the local server should be up and running

In the `.env.sample` file you can find the `REACT_APP_API_KEY` variable which has to be set to your own API key by registering to [The Movie Database](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs).
